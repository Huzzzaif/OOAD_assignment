Developer Meeting Log

Date: 2024-11-12
Meeting Type: Nodes & Physics Module Meeting

Present:

Jacques Lucke
Simon Thommes
Hans Goudey
Mattias
Drew Medina
Since the Last Meeting:

The Blender conference
Geometry Nodes Workshop 2
Lots of bug fixing, limited development work
Meeting Topics:

User Documentation

Many sections of documentation are still missing for the release.
Gizmos are documented from the “gizmo user” perspective rather than from the perspective of creating gizmos.
Subpanels

General consensus that subpanels are a reasonable feature.
Simon will allocate time to test this.
Clip By Plane

Plan appears solid; only “clipped” faces should be triangulated.
Edge loop holes will be filled with a separate node. Although combining operations could improve performance, separation is preferable for now.
Discussion on optimizing for multiple slices in one mesh.
Hair Simulation Project Planning

Jacques created a basic PBD solver prototype to enhance understanding.
Consideration for more frequent video meetings.
Jacques will focus on asset embedding, and Hans on socket shapes.
Quality Project

December will mainly focus on reviewing old bugs.
Hans has planned some refactoring work.
Triangulate Rewrite

Currently stalled, though edge deduplication has been implemented.
Jacques may review the PR to push forward.
